GW2-KR-DTimer
=============

This is a quick timer application for dragons respawn calculation in guild wars 2 online game.
Build for 'Roche d'Augure' server first, maybe more servers later if other players use it.

Based on:
- a rest-service written in PHP/PDO/Slim to access database
- a client web application (full javascript: require/backbone/marionette/underscore/boostrap)


Feel free for comments / improvements and don't hesite to report bugs.

Thanks.
